- Project Description

    * The "Text Recognition and Information Extraction" project leverages Python and the Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library to perform text recognition and extraction from images. This project demonstrates the capabilities of Tesseract for recognizing text in various contexts and extracting specific information from images.
   

- Project Overview

    * Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts images of text into machine-readable text. This project showcases how to use Tesseract, a widely-used OCR engine, to recognize and extract text from images. The project covers several aspects of text recognition, including installation, language support, page segmentation modes, text detection, and information extraction.

Key Features:

Installation and Setup:

Detailed instructions for installing Tesseract and the pytesseract Python wrapper are provided.
Demonstrates how to install required language data for different languages.
Basic Text Recognition:

Shows how to read an image, convert it to RGB format, and perform text recognition using Tesseract.
Illustrates the process of recognizing text in multiple languages.
Page Segmentation Modes (PSM):

Introduces different page segmentation modes for handling varied text layouts and structures.
Provides examples of how to configure Tesseract to handle different text layouts.
Page Orientation Detection:

Utilizes the Tesseract OSD (Orientation and Script Detection) feature to determine page orientation.
Text Detection and Visualization:

Demonstrates text detection using the image_to_data function and visualizes detected text blocks.
Provides options to adjust confidence thresholds and visualize text boxes around detected text.
Information Extraction:

Illustrates the use of regular expressions for extracting specific types of information, such as dates, from detected text.
Shows how to identify and extract structured data using text recognition.
Real-World Text Recognition:

Showcases text recognition in natural scenes, such as images with text on objects like cups.
Highlights the capability of Tesseract to recognize text in various real-world scenarios.
Benefits and Learning:

Gain insights into OCR technology and its applications.
Learn how to install and configure Tesseract for text recognition.
Understand different page segmentation modes and their effects.
Explore text detection and bounding box visualization.
Discover techniques for extracting structured information from recognized text.
Acquire knowledge of real-world text recognition challenges and solutions.
Usage:

This project's code can be used as a guide for implementing text recognition and information extraction using Tesseract and Python. Users can follow the provided examples to perform text recognition on their own images, customize parameters for different use cases, and extract specific information from detected text.

Note:
It's important to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies, such as Tesseract and the required language data, installed before running the code. The project's code and examples are provided in Python and utilize the pytesseract library for interacting with the Tesseract OCR engine.

Contributions to this project are welcome! You can improve documentation, add more examples, optimize code, or extend functionality. Feel free to open issues and pull requests on the GitHub repository to enhance the project and make it more valuable to the community.
